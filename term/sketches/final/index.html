<p>CHENKUN ZHAO Sketch Final</p>

<p>Sketch 1: As sleep hours increase, afternoon energy increases; at the same sleep duration, more
energy drinks within 6h before bed are associated with lower afternoon energy </p>
<p>Encoding: X=SleepHours, Y=AfternoonEnergy, Size=SleepQuality, Color=EnergyDrinks</p>
<p>Data used:Afternoon Energy(1-5):1=bad 5=best, Sleep Hours (h):1Hrs-12Hrs, Energy Drinks(cup):0-3, Sleep Quality (1–10):1=bad 10=best.——

<p>Sketch 2: Earlier bedtimes are associated with longer sleep and higher sleep quality.</p>
 <p>Encoding: line 1=Bedtime Bucket(Early / Mid / Late), line 2=SleepHours, line 3=SleepQuality, line 4=MorningMood(1-5)</p>
 <p>Data used:Bedtime Bucket(Early/Mid/Late):Early<=11:00, Mid<=12:30, Late>12:30. Sleep Hours (h):1Hrs-12Hrs. Sleep Quality(1–10):1=bad, 10=good. Morning Mood(1-5):1=bad, 5=good.——

<p>Sketch 3: As sleep hours increase, daily mood increases. As drink energy drink increases, daily mood decreases. 
  <p>Encoding: Color=Energy Drinks (6h pre-bed) — Encoding: Angle1=SleepHours, Angle2=SleepQuality, Angle3=EnergyDrinks, Angle4=MorningMood, Angle5=AfternoonMood, Angle6=EveningMood</p>
  <p>Data used: Sleep Hours (h):1Hrs-12Hrs. Sleep Quality(1–10):1=bad, 10=good. Morning Mood(1-5):1=bad, 5=good. Afternoon Mood
(1-5):1=bad 5=good. Evening Mood(1-5): 1=bad 5=good.——

<p>Sketch 4: Drinking energy drinks before going to bed can affect the duration and quality of sleep. 
  <p>Encoding: red dot=EnergyDrinks, Pointer1=FallingAsleepTime, Pointer2=WeakUpTime, Color=SleepQuality</p>
  <p>Data used:Energy Drinks(cup):0-3. FallingAsleepTime(time).WeakUpTime(time). Sleep Quality (1–10):1=bad 10=best.——

  <li>For Sketch 2, my inspiration comes from the Parallel Coordinates chart. I think the Parallel Coordinates chart can express my data very clearly. My data is about sleep, daytime mood and the influence of energy drinks. I think I can make the relationship between them very clear to users through straight lines. I made a few changes to the style. I transformed the entire data into a vertical format. I think this way of expression is clearer. — <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/parallel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parallel Coordinates chart (D3 Graph Gallery)</a></li>
  
  <li>For Sketch 3, my inspiration comes from the Spider chart. A radar or spider or web chart is a two-dimensional chart type designed to plot one or more series of values over multiple quantitative variables. So this is very suitable for my data. Because my data has many variables. It can help users better understand my data and make my data more accurate. I can also understand whether my Hypothesis are accurate. — <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/spider.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider chart (D3 Graph Gallery)</a></li>

  <li>For Sketch 4, through the previous website, I have developed my own ideas. I combine data with tables. I think this can clearly express that energy drinks can affect sleep quality. But the drawback is that it would be very troublesome if I were to record a large amount of data.</li>
