            <strong>Data collected from: Sep 25 - Dec 2, recorded once per day.</strong>

            This project explores the relationship between my daily sleep habits and my morning mood. 
From late September to early December, I recorded four properties each day: 
<strong>sleep hours</strong>, <strong>sleep quality (1-10)</strong>, <strong>energy drink intake (0-3 cups)</strong>, 
and <strong>morning mood (1-5)</strong>. The goal of this visualization is to see whether longer sleep leads to better mood, 
and whether drinking more energy drinks is linked to shorter and lower-quality sleep. 
My data ranges from 6-12 hours of sleep, mood scores from 1-5, and energy drink intake from 0-3 cups, 
providing enough variation to reveal meaningful patterns.
<br><br>
<strong>How did I record it?:</strong> wake-up time is determined by checking the time as soon as I wake up each day. My bedtime is tracked by my Apple Watch, which tells me when I fall asleep. I assess sleep quality by whether I feel warm or cold when I wake up each day. My morning mood is determined by whether I want to exercise or eat breakfast; if I'm in a bad mood, I won't want to exercise or eat breakfast.
<br><br>
<strong>Why do I want to record it?:</strong>Sometimes I'm incredibly slow at work, while other times I can accomplish a lot. I suspect it's due to my sleep. But I don't know why my sleep is sometimes so bad, so I want to track my sleep patterns to find the cause.
<br><br>
<strong>Summarize:</strong>I've found that drinking energy drinks six hours before bed has a significant impact on my sleep onset time and sleep duration, which in turn affects my morning mood and sleep quality. And sleep quality and morning mood, in turn, affect my productivity throughout the day.
