  Doraemon was my favorite cartoon in my childhood. In Asia, it is every child’s dream companion.
  When we hear this music, we know he is coming!

  <figcaption>Plot

Doraemon tells the story of Doraemon, a blue robotic cat from the 22nd century, who is sent back to the 20th century by his owner (a descendant of Nobita Nobi) to help a clumsy, timid, and often troubled elementary school student.
Doraemon has a "four-dimensional pocket" in his stomach that can produce various magical gadgets, such as a portal, a bamboo dragonfly, and a time machine. These gadgets often help Nobita solve problems, but his reliance on them or their improper use often leads to comical consequences.</figcaption>
