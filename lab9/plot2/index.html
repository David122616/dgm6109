        <p class="hypothesis">
            Hypothesis: As energy drink consumption (within 6 hours before bed) increases, sleep quality decreases.
            For adequate sleep duration (8+ hours), this negative effect becomes more apparent.
        </p>
        
        <p class="explanation">
            This is one of my best scatterplots because it directly tests whether energy drinks impact sleep quality 
            independently of sleep duration. By using <strong>Array.filter()</strong> to isolate nights with adequate 
            sleep (8+ hours), we eliminate sleep deprivation as a confounding variable and can clearly see energy 
            drinks' effect on quality. The <strong>Array.sort()</strong> function organizes data by sleep hours, 
            creating a visual gradient that reveals an interesting pattern: even with long sleep, high energy drink 
            consumption consistently produces smaller circles (lower quality). The color gradient for afternoon energy 
            adds another dimension, showing that poor sleep quality from energy drinks also correlates with next-day fatigue.
